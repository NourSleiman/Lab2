# Lab2

Task 2 of the lab required to record the terminal history to create a SVN repository, create and add a file, modify the file and commit it.
The history can be found in the session.log document.

Task 3 involved writing a makefile or shell script to do basic analysis on a csv file. All files pertaining to this task can be found in the DataAnalysis folder.
The csv file used is movies.csv, a list from MovieLens that contains the movie name, release date, and genres.
The shell script is named movieCount.sh.
movieCount.sh utilizes awk to filter through the data to determine the yearly count of movies as well as the yearly count of movies per genre.
The result is labeled movieDistribution.
